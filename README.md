# TITANIC - Machine Learning from Disaster
<b><text align="center">PREDICT SURVIVAL ON THE TITANIC WITH NA√èVE BAYES</b>

<p>üö¢ The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. üìÜ On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the deaths of 1502 of the 2224 passengers and crew. While there is an element of luck involved in survival, it seems that some groups of people are more likely to survive than others. <br/>

This program contains a predictive model that answers the question: "which kind of person is more likely to survive?" using passenger data (i.e. name, age, gender, socioeconomic class, etc.). The data is divided into two parts, namely training set and test set. 
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the "ground truth") for each passenger. Your model will be based on "features" like passengers' gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features. The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.
